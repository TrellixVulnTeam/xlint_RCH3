# About

Script to scan a directory and run the appropriate code linters depending on
the file type.

# Usage

Build the linters with

    setup.py

Add the xlint directory to your path or simlink the xlint script in a directory
which is already on your path.

Then you can run it anywhere with

    xlint

You can pass a path as an argument, otherwise the current directory is scanned.
